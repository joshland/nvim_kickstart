# nvim_kickstart

Thanks to Prime, I am a new nvim user.  Since it requires local build and I end up managing lots of systems, I wanted a fast means of native deployment.

I looked for an existing collection, but finding none that suited my needs, I modified this from another collection, and set it up to favor my own  deployment requirements.
